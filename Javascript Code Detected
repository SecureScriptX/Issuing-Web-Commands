**Analysis of XSS Attack Attempt:**

Upon inspecting the query parameter, it is evident that there exists an XSS payload. Given that the payload is embedded in the URL, it has been identified as a "Reflected type" XSS attack.

Further investigation, specifically filtering by source IP address on the Log Management page, reveals that the attacker attempted various XSS payloads.

Notably, the requests associated with the attack were observed to be redirected with a 302 status code. Consequently, the attack did not achieve its intended success.

Considering the unsuccessful outcome, escalation to the next level is deemed unnecessary.
