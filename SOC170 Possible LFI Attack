# Analysis of LFI Attack

The presence of an LFI attack, particularly targeting the "URL" parameter, raises concerns about potential security vulnerabilities within the web application. The manual nature of the attack, indicated by the repeated attempts, implies a deliberate and focused effort by the attacker. The intricate payloads used in the attack suggest a level of sophistication and an intent to manipulate the system for malicious purposes.

While the attempt was unsuccesful, and the server responded with an error (HTTP status code 500), it is crucial to conduct a thorough security analysis to identify and address any underlying vulnerabilities. Additionally, monitoring and further investigation into the source IP address (106.55.45.162) are recommended to mitigate future potential threats.

## Summary

The web application has experienced a targeted LFI attack with a manual execution. This underscores the importance of ongoing security measures and continuous monitoring to safeguard against potential exploits and unauthorized access.
