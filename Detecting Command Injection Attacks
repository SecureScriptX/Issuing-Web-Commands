# Command Injection Vulnerabilities


### Mitigation

To prevent command injection vulnerabilities, it is crucial to thoroughly sanitize user-input data. This involves validating and escaping user-provided content to ensure it cannot be interpreted as commands by the system.


### Understanding Command Injection Attacks

Attackers leverage command injection vulnerabilities to execute unauthorized commands on an operating system, posing a serious threat to both the web application and server components.


### Prevention Measures

Implement the following practices to mitigate the risk of command injection:


### 1. Sanitize User Input

Always thoroughly sanitize data received from users, including file names. Avoid placing trust in user-input data to prevent potential vulnerabilities.

### 2. Limit User Rights

Adjust the user rights of the web application to a lower level whenever feasible. Admin rights are seldom necessary for most web applications, reducing the impact of potential attacks.

### 3. Utilize Virtualization Technologies

Deploy virtualization technologies like Docker to isolate and secure application environments, adding an extra layer of protection against command injection exploits.


### Detecting Command Injection Attacks

Timely detection of command injection attacks is essential to prevent financial losses and safeguard the company's reputation. Employ the following detection methods:

### 1. Examine All Web Request Areas

Thoroughly inspect all areas of a web request, as command injection vulnerabilities may be present in various parts of the web application's operation.

### 2. Look for Terminal Language Keywords

Scrutinize user-received data for keywords associated with terminal commands, such as 'dir,' 'ls,' 'cp,' 'cat,' 'type,' etc. Identifying these keywords is crucial for spotting potential vulnerabilities.

### 3. Familiarize with Command Injection Payloads

Stay informed about frequently used command injection payloads. Attackers often employ reverse shells, and knowledge of common payloads is essential for effective detection.


**Conclusion:** Adopting proactive prevention and detection measures is crucial to safeguard against command injection attacks, preserving both financial resources and the company's reputation.
