## üõ°Ô∏è What is IDOR?

Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) is a critical vulnerability stemming from inadequate or improperly implemented authorization mechanisms. It allows unauthorized access to objects, putting sensitive information at risk. As the top-ranked security risk in OWASP's 2021 list, IDOR, or "Broken Access Control," demands attention.

### üíª How IDOR Works:

Unlike other web vulnerabilities, IDOR isn't caused by unsanitary conditions but rather by manipulating parameters sent to a web application. Attackers exploit this vulnerability to access objects belonging to others, potentially reading, altering, or erasing contents.

### üîç Example Scenario:

Consider a basic web app retrieving user data based on the "id" variable:
URL: [https://letsdefend.io/get_user_information?id=1](https://letsdefend.io/get_user_information?id=1)

If the app doesn't verify if the "id" in the request belongs to the requester, anyone can access personal information by changing the "id" parameter. This vulnerability is IDOR.

### ü§î How Attackers Exploit IDOR:

Attackers exploit IDOR to:
- Steal personal information
- Access unauthorized documents
- Conduct unauthorized processes (e.g., deletion, alteration)

### üîê Preventing IDOR:

To secure against IDOR, always verify the requester's authority. Remove unnecessary parameters, taking only essential ones. In the example, session information could replace the need for the "id" parameter.

### üïµÔ∏è Detecting IDOR Attacks:

IDOR attacks are challenging to detect compared to other attacks. Key methods include:
- Checking all parameters for vulnerabilities
- Monitoring the number of requests for the same page
- Identifying patterns in requests (e.g., sequential values like id=1, id=2)

### IDOR Attack Investigation

#### Questions to Address:

1. **IP Address of Attacker:**
   - What is the IP address of the attacker who executed the IDOR attack?

2. **Attack Timeline:**
   - When did the attack commence?

3. **Attack Success:**
   - Was the IDOR attack successful?

4. **Automated Tool Usage:**
   - Was the attack carried out using an automated tool? (Nessus, OpenVas, Nikto)
